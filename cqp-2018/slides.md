# Front Matter

## Agenda

::: incremental

- Share my experiences operating portable in the 2018 [California QSO Party](http://cqp.org/)
- Show off some photos taken along the way &#x1f4f8;
- Present without presentation software &#x1f60e;
- Don't use any emoji more than once &#x1f913; (except &#x1f4f8;)

:::

## Primary Objectives

What did I want to accomplish for this portable operation?

::: incremental

- Celebrate being a life-long California resident &#x1f389;
- Give out a relatively rare county to out-of-state contesters.
- Operate at moderate power in a low-noise natural setting. &#x1f332;
- Learn lessons for future portable operations.
- A _satisfying_ number of QSOs.
- Enjoy a weekend out of the house! &#x1f334; But not too far out.

:::

## Targets of Opportunity

What would make things better if it happened, but no worse if it didn't?

::: incremental

- A _large_ number of QSOs. &#x1f633;
- More running time than search-and-pounce time.
- Bum some overnight crash space from my parents! &#x1f606;

:::

## What to Avoid

::: incremental

- Operating QRP, or effectively so &#x1f910;
- 100% search-and-pounce time
- Angry park rangers
- Losing my voice &#x1f636;
- Injuries &#x1f915; and illnesses &#x1f912;
- Wildfires &#x1f525;

:::

# Preparation

## Selecting Locations

One week before the event I visited [http://cqp.org/](http://cqp.org/)
and looked for unclaimed counties.

::: incremental

- Stanislaus and Yolo are not claimed yet.
- I drive through northeastern Stanislaus County whenever I visit my parents.
- I wonder if the contest organizers know any operating spots? &#x1f914;

:::

## Mail from More Experienced Operators

So I sent mail to the contest organizers.

> I'm interested in operating from Stanislaus County.  I would prefer to
> operate from a nature-oriented location somewhere near highway 120, as
> that's how I would travel from my residence in Alameda County to visit
> family, but if there are better locations elsewhere I would like to hear
> about them.

Certainly the members of the 
[Northern California Contest Club](http://nccc.cc/)
would know something about portable operating spots!

## Bob N6TV

> Any ideas Alan?

## Alan AD6E/KH6TU

> I took a quick look at Google Earth, and there seems to
> be a nice little park called Orange Blossom Recreation Area about 4
> miles east of Oakdale...GL, I'm going to need STAN myself this time.

## Glen W6JB

> Tom,
> Glad to hear you will going to
> Stanislaus...Maybe someone on the email list will have a suggestion
> for a good location.

Tom?  Who's Tom?! &#x1f620;

# Saturday

## Scouting: Turlock Lake

East of Modesto on CA-132.  A (metaphorical) stone's throw from the
Tuolumne River.

## What would make a decent location?

::: incremental

* Open to day use.  Day use entrance is on northwest side.
* Nearby bathroom.
* Close to parking.
* Plenty of lake view.

:::

## How about the northwest shore of the lake?

::: incremental

* Southeast corner of `CM97qp`
* Lots of parched grass nearby...
* Power lines across the road...
* Not really flat and level...
* Almost completely exposed to the elements... &#x1f31e;

:::

## We'll take it!

## A Parking Lot with a View &#x1f4f8;

A local grandmother who brought her two grandchildren said the lake
was very full!

## Setting Up

::: incremental

* Weather was pleasant, partly cloudy and breezy...
* ...but setup was a drag!
* I didn't have suitable stakes for sandy ground.
* Of all the tools in the world, why did I forget a hammer &#x1f528; to drive the stakes that I did have? 
* Too many trips on a sloped path between the beach and the car, without a wagon or dolly.

:::

## Shade tents are made for days like this &#x1f4f8;

## Antenna setup &#x1f4f8;

With Extremely Sophisticated *(cough)* Radial System.

## Saturday Operating Summary

::: incremental

* Noisy all day (S4-S5 on 15 and 20 meters). &#x1f4a5;
* Was it the power lines or the generator?
* 40 meters was useless (S9 noise floor). &#x1f4a3;
* Chair was perhaps better for tailgating than operating.
* Teardown was faster than setup but possibly more of a drag...
* ...because my car was up a hill and I didn't have a wagon! &#x1f3cb;

:::

## Relaxing on Saturday Evening &#x1f4f8;

Dog tax!  Meet Misty, my parents' 8-pound toy poodle, who wouldn't
smile for the camera.

# Sunday

## Morning Sightseeing: Knights Ferry

::: incremental

- East of Oakdale on CA-108/CA-120, straddles `CM97pt` and `CM97qt`
- One of the [Stanislaus River Parks](https://www.stanislausriver.com/parks/)
- Longest covered bridge west of the Mississippi River!
- Former grain mill and hydroelectric generator station.
- Popular site for river rafters to put in, but possibly not that day

:::

## Scouting: Orange Blossom Park

::: incremental

* A few miles east of Oakdale, on the north side of the Stanislaus River.
* Northeast corner of `CM97os`
* Right next to the river, but basically in a valley.
* Nice place for a picnic, but possibly not for daytime HF operating.
* We had another place in mind anyway, let's move on.

:::

## Scouting: Woodward Reservoir

A few miles north of Oakdale on county highway J14. Takes up a lot of `CM97nu`.

<iframe width="1024" height="768" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="https://www.openstreetmap.org/export/embed.html?bbox=-120.99260330200197%2C37.7342043518508%2C-120.70592880249025%2C37.879460301422576&amp;layer=mapnik" style="border: 1px solid black"></iframe><br/><small><a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=13/37.8069/-120.8493">View Larger Map</a></small>

## A Closer Look at Woodward Reservoir

So where to operate here?

::: incremental

* The road to the peninsula in the middle of the reservoir was closed.
* How about picnic areas on the west shore?
* Definitely more flat and more level than yesterday!
* Green grass, shade trees, concrete picnic tables...
* ...but very windy today.  &#x1f32c;
* Maybe we can make use of bushes and trees.

:::

## We'll take it!

![Picnic area on west shore of Woodward Reservoir](img/woodward-res-west-shore.png)

## View from the Water's Edge &#x1f4f8;

This looks like a pleasant spot, even if we're not operating.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/57994780@N04/43637281140/in/datetaken/" title="IMG_8949"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1928/43637281140_c7f3203a2a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="298" alt="IMG_8949"></a><script async src="https://embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Setting Up

::: incremental

* Setup was easier than yesterday!
* Table, seating, and shade were already provided.
* Used another concrete picnic table to block acoustic and possibly RF noise from the generator.
* Used a bush to shield the antenna from the stiff wind!

:::

## Using natural features to my advantage &#x1f4f8;

Flimsy camera tripod not falling over in the wind, thanks to a nearby
bush.

## Let's operate! &#x1f4f8;

The antenna hasn't fallen over after a few minutes, so let's try to
make some contacts!

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/57994780@N04/45402367032/in/datetaken/" title="IMG_8949"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1907/45402367032_dd1b05be3c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="IMG_8949"></a><script async src="https://embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Nobody came to visit &#x1f4f8;

No visitors all day!  Well, almost.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/57994780@N04/45862530734/in/datetaken/" title="IMG_9012"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4875/45862530734_f37582836c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="IMG_9012"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Sunday Operating Summary

::: incremental

* Noise floor was much lower, S0.  Easier to make those contacts!
* Got most of my contacts for the contest from calling CQ on 21373 and holding it for a lot longer than I expected! &#x1f929;
* No pileup, but it was fun to be a wanted station.
* Maybe this solo portable operating thing is really a thing!
* Teardown was only about 15 minutes.
* Back home within 3 hours of contest end.

:::

# Contest Log

## Map of Completed Contacts

<iframe src="map.html" width="1480" height="800"></iframe>

## Summary

::: incremental

* 85 QSOs, 74 unique calls
* 30 on Saturday, 55 on Sunday
* 35 on 20 meters, 49 on 15 meters
* 84 via phone, 1 via CW
* 84 out-of-state, 1 in-state (but enough to claim the multiplier!)

:::

## Highlights

::: incremental

- 36 contacts in 55 minutes from calling CQ and running on 21373 on Sunday &#x1f600;
- Stopped running when only Tennessee was answering, and not often.
- Made it as far as Alaska, Maine, and Florida.
- Nothing off-continent.  Where were Hawaii and Japan? &#x1f61e;
- About a dozen "thanks for the new county!" &#x1f44d;

# Lessons Learned

## Tools

::: incremental

* Should have made a packing list and worked from it.
* Shade tent was a good idea.  Even better when you don't need it!
* Should have brought a hammer for stakes.
* Should have brought corkscrew sand stakes.
* Should have brought a wagon to make hauling gear easier.

:::

## Antenna

::: incremental

* Vertical antenna low to the ground got good distance...
* ...but in-state was very difficult!
* Holy Skip, Batman!  Out of state, nothing closer than Colorado.
* Should have brought an NVIS dipole to get 6- and 7-land.
* Unknown if Extremely Sophisticated *(cough)* Radial System had any effect.  It probably didn't hurt.

:::

## Power

::: incremental

* Generators are useful but noisy and smelly and fussy. &#x26fd;
* For daylight-only operations with 100 watts, a battery and solar setup should be sufficient.
* For less than 5 hours per day at 100 watts, a big battery should be sufficient. &#x1f50b;

:::

## Location

::: incremental

* Visiting ahead of time is invaluable, but not always possible. &#x1f4b0;
* Prior research with a web browser can help.
  - [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/)
  - [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)
  - [Google Earth](https://www.google.com/earth/)
* Hilltops covered with parched grass are not attractive to generator users.  &#x1f692;
* Convenient bushes can help flimsy verticals remain upright on windy days...
* ...but a weight system is probably a better idea!
* Operating portable can help you meet the locals...
* ...if any locals are out and about.

:::

## Operating

::: incremental

* Should have set up recordings to save my voice, at least for calling CQ.  &#x1f399;
* Calling CQ in an empty spot on 15 meters got me most of my QSOs...
* ...until all I got was a thin stream of Tennessee.  Time to change tactics.
* N1MM is actually good software. &#x1f632;  Surprising for someone who wrote [this presentation](https://tnalpgge.github.io/presentations/frugal-ham-shack-computer/).
* Being a desirable station can be fun! &#x1f601;
