# Preparation

## Agenda

::: incremental

- Share my experiences operating portable in the 2018 [California QSO Party](http://cqp.org/)
- Show off some photos taken along the way &#x1f4f8;
- Present without presentation software &#x1f60e;
- Don't use any emoji more than once &#x1f913;

## Primary Objectives

What did I want to accomplish for this portable operation?

::: "incremental"

- Celebrate being a life-long California resident &#x1f389;
- Give out a relatively rare county to out-of-state contesters.
- Operate at moderate power in a low-noise natural setting. &#x1f332;
- Learn lessons for future portable operations.
- A _satisfying_ number of QSOs.
- Enjoy a weekend out of the house! &#x1f334; But not too far out.

## Targets of Opportunity

What would make things better if it happened, but no worse if it didn't?

::: incremental

- A _large_ number of QSOs. &#x1f633;
- More running time than search-and-pounce time.
- Bum some overnight crash space from my parents! &#x1f606;

:::

## What to Avoid

::: incremental

- Operating QRP, or effectively so &#x1f910;
- 100% search-and-pounce time
- Angry park rangers
- Losing my voice &#x1f636;
- Injuries &#x1f915; and illnesses &#x1f912;
- Wildfires &#x1f525;

:::

## Selecting Locations

One week before the event I visited http://cqp.org/ and looked for
unclaimed counties.

::: incremental

- Hm, Stanislaus and Yolo aren't claimed yet... 
- I drive through northeastern Stanislaus County whenever I visit my parents...
- I wonder if the contest organizers know any operating spots? &#x1f914;
