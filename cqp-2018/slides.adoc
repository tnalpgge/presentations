:subtitle: California QSO Party 2018
:conference-sponsor: South Bay Amateur Radio Association
:conference-title: General Meeting
:conference-dates: Month Year


== Primary Objectives

[role="incremental"]
- Give out a relatively rare county to out-of-state contesters
- Operate at moderate power in a low-noise natural setting
- Learn lessons for future portable operations
- A satisfying number of QSOs
- Enjoy a weekend out of the house!  But not too far out.

== Targets of Opportunity

[role="incremental"]
- Celebrate being a life-long California resident
- A large number of QSOs
- More running time than search-and-pounce time
- Bum some overnight crash space from my parents :-)
 
== What to Avoid

[role="incremental"]
- Operating QRP, or effectively so
- 100% search-and-pounce time
- Angry park rangers
- Losing my voice
- Injuries and illnesses
- Wildfires

== Selecting Locations

One week before the event I visited http://cqp.org/ and looked for
unclaimed counties.

[role="incremental"]
- Hm, Stanislaus and Yolo aren't claimed yet...
- I drive through northeastern Stanislaus County whenever I visit my parents...
- I wonder if the contest organizers know any operating spots?

== Mail from More Experienced Operators

Any ideas Alan?

I took a quick look at Google Earth, and there seems to
be a nice little park called Orange Blossom Recreation Area about 4
miles east of Oakdale...GL, I'm going to need STAN myself this time.

Tom,
Glad to hear you will going to
Stanislaus...Maybe someone on the email list will have a suggestion
for a good location.

[role="incremental"]
Tom?  Who's Tom?!

== Equipment

[role="incremental"]
- ICOM IC-7200 transceiver, covering 160m-6m
- MFJ-902B transmatch
- Outbacker 500 vertical, covering 75m-10m
- Extremely sophisticated ground radial system
- Modified camera tripod
- Laptop computer with N1MM
- Borrowed generator
- Shade tent
- Folding table
- Folding chair
- Toolbox
- Overnight bag
- 2011 Volkswagen Jetta TDI Sportwagen, without emissions modification

== Saturday: Turlock Lake State Recreation Area

[role="TODO"]
- General location
  - East of Modesto on CA-132
  - A stone's throw from the Tuolumne River
- Specific operating location - not bad, but not that good either
  - Northwest shore of lake
  - southeast corner of CM97qp
  - 37.625737 North 120.588798 West
  - Narrow strip of beach with lots of parched grass nearby
  - Power lines across the road
  - Not really flat and level
  - Almost completely exposed to the elements
- Setup was a drag
  - Lacked suitable stakes for sandy ground
  - Lacked hammer to drive in what stakes I did have
  - Too many trips on a sloped path between the beach and the car
- Weather was pleasant, partly cloudy and breezy
- Operating
  - Noisy all day; don't know if it was power lines or generator
  - Chair was perhaps better for tailgating than operating
- Teardown was faster than setup but just as much of a drag

== Sightseeing Sunday: Knight's Ferry

[role="TODO"]
- One of the Stanislaus River parks.  https://www.stanislausriver.com/parks/
- Longest covered bridge west of the Mississippi River!
- Former grain mill and hydroelectric generator station.
- Managed by the Army Corps of Engineers.

== Sunday: Woodward Reservoir County Park

[role="TODO"]
- General location
  - North of Oakdale
- Specific location
  - West shore of lake, in a picnic area
  - Middle of CM97nu
  - 37.849548 North 120.876965 West
  - Green grass, shade trees, concrete picnic tables
  - Definitely more flat and more level
- Setup was easier
  - Table, seating, and shade were already taken care of
  - Used one of the tables to block acoustic and RF noise from generator
  - Used a bush to shield the antenna from the wind
- Weather was very windy!
- Operating
  - Noise floor was much lower
  - Easier to make those contacts
  - Skip just as bad, but heard more in-state stations
  - Called CQ on 21373 and held it for a lot longer than I expected
- Teardown was 15 minutes or so
- Back home within 3 hours of contest end

== Log Summary

[role="TODO"]
- 85 QSO
- 30 Saturday, 55 Sunday
- 35 on 20m, 49 on 15m
- 1 CW, 84 Phone
- 1 in-state -- very weak and in same county
- 84 out-of-state, none closer than Colorado, but got all the way to Alaska, Florida, and Maine!
- About a dozen "thanks for the new county" :-)
- 36 QSO in 55 minutes from running on 21373 on Sunday



== Lessons Learned: Tools

- Shade tent was a good idea.
- Should have brought a hammer!
- Should have brought a wagon!
- Should have brought a tarp!
- Should have brought corkscrew sand stakes for the shade tent!

== Lessons Learned: Antenna

[role="incremental"]
- Vertical antenna low to the ground got good distance, but in-state was very difficult!
- Holy Skip, Batman!  Out of state, nothing closer than Colorado.
- Should have brought a dipole and supports to use NVIS to get more in-state QSOs.


== Lessons Learned: Power

[role="incremental"]
- Between nearby power lines and the generator, 40 meters was useless at Turlock Lake :-(
- Generators are useful but noisy and fussy.
- For daylight-only operations, a big battery should be sufficient.
- A solar panel could top up the battery during the day to extend nighttime operating hours.

== Lessons Learned: Location
[role="incremental"]
- Visiting ahead of time is invaluable, but not always possible.
- Hilltops covered with parched grass are not attractive to generator users.
- Convenient bushes can allow flimsy verticals to remain upright on windy days!

== Lessons Learned: Operating

[role="incremental"]
- Should have set up recordings to save my voice, at least for calling CQ.
- Calling CQ in an empty spot on 15 meters got me most of my QSOs...
- ...until all I got was a thin stream of Tennessee, and then it was time to change tactics.
- N1MM is actually good software.
