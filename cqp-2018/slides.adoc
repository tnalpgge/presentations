== Primary Objectives

[role="incremental"]
- Give out a relatively rare county to out-of-state contesters
- Operate at moderate power in a low-noise natural setting
- Learn lessons for future portable operations
- A satisfying number of QSOs


== Targets of Opportunity

[role="incremental"]
- A large number of QSOs
- Celebrate being a life-long California resident
- More running time than search-and-pounce time
- Eat bologna sandwiches for lunch
- Bum crash space from my parents overnight
 
== What to Avoid

[role="incremental"]
- QRP
- 100% search-and-pounce time
- Angry park rangers
- Losing my voice by spending lots of time calling CQ and getting no answers
- Injuries and illnesses
- Wildfires

== Selecting Locations

== Equipment

== Saturday: Turlock Lake State Recreation Area

== Sunday: Woodward Reservoir County Park

== Log Summary

== Lessons Learned: Tools

- Shade tent was a good idea.
- Should have brought a hammer!
- Should have brought a wagon!
- Should have brought a tarp!
- Should have brought corkscrew sand stakes for the shade tent!

== Lessons Learned: Antenna

[role="incremental"]
- Vertical antenna low to the ground got good distance, but in-state was very difficult!
- Holy Skip, Batman!  Out of state, nothing closer than Colorado.
- Should have brought a dipole and supports to use NVIS to get more in-state QSOs.


== Lessons Learned: Power

[role="incremental"]
- Between nearby power lines and the generator, 40 meters was useless at Turlock Lake :-(
- Generators are useful but noisy and fussy.
- For daylight-only operations, a big battery should be sufficient.
- A solar panel could top up the battery during the day to extend nighttime operating hours.

== Lessons Learned: Location
[role="incremental"]
- Visiting ahead of time is invaluable, but not always possible.
- Hilltops covered with parched grass are not attractive to generator users.
- Convenient bushes can allow flimsy verticals to remain upright on windy days!

== Lessons Learned: Operating

[role="incremental"]
- Should have set up recordings to save my voice, at least for calling CQ.
- Calling CQ in an empty spot on 15 meters got me most of my QSOs...
- ...until all I got was a thin stream of Tennessee, and then it was time to change tactics.
